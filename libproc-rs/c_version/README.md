# Pathfind
This 'C' version of 'pathfind' can be compiled to create the command "pathfind" using "make" at the command line.
 
The produced binary "pathfind" takes a process PID argument and returns the fully qualified path to the executable being run with that PID.

# Platforms
At the moment it just has been compiled and tested on Mac OS X using libproc.
